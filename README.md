# ESCCML: Epoch-Split Codec Convergence Manifest Ledger

A sovereign-grade ledger protocol designed for validator-class throughput, forensic auditability, and infra-native economics.

---

## 🧠 What Is ESCCML?

ESCCML (Epoch-Split Codec Convergence Manifest Ledger) is a post-blockchain protocol that replaces block-based consensus with manifest-sealed finality, lock-free ingestion, and codec-native determinism. It enables validator-class performance on commodity hardware while enforcing economic realism and audit-grade replayability.

## 🔩 Core Components

### 🔹 Manifest
- Atomic unit of state transition
- Sealed with Merkle root, validator signature, codec hash, and timestamp
- Guarantees deterministic finality and replayability

### 🔹 Ledger
- Lock-free WAL ingestion pipeline
- >9M TPS on M2-class hardware
- Sub-2.5ms flush p95 under durable workloads

### 🔹 Codec
- Channelized encoding (Y/Cb/Cr-style)
- Integer-only accounting
- Zero-copy Merkle hashing and light-client support

### 🔹 Convergence
- Manifest-first agreement model
- Friend-batch detection replaces BFT
- Validator rewards tied to output identity, not stake weight

### 🔹 Epoch-Split Anchoring
- Time-indexed state convergence
- Supports asynchronous validation across latency zones (Earth-Mars, disaster mesh)
- Enables jurisdictional leasing and policy divergence

## ⚖️ Economic Primitives

- **Piggy Bank Accumulator**: Recycles transaction dust into governance pools
- **Privilege Decay**: Penalizes idle stake, enforces continuous validator contribution
- **Stake-to-Throughput Ratio (S:T)**: Aligns rewards with measurable work

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters

ESCCML proves that decentralized ledgers can be:

- **Validator-class performant**
- **Auditably deterministic**
- **Energy-efficient (~1.4×10⁻¹² kWh/tx)**
- **Governable by execution, not speculation**

It’s not just a protocol—it’s a substrate for infra-native value streams, planetary coordination, and sovereign-grade currency systems.
