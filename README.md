# ESCCML: Epoch-Split Codec Convergence Manifest Ledger

A sovereign-grade ledger protocol designed for validator-class throughput, forensic auditability, and infra-native economics.

## 🧠 What Is ESCCML?

ESCCML (Epoch-Split Codec Convergence Manifest Ledger) is a post-blockchain protocol that replaces block-based consensus with manifest-sealed finality, GPU-native hydration, and codec-deterministic replay. It enables validator-class performance on commodity hardware while enforcing throughput realism, privilege decay, and audit-grade convergence.

## 🔩 Core Components

### 🔹 Manifest
- Atomic unit of state transition
- Sealed with Merkle root, output identity, codec hash, and timestamp
- Guarantees deterministic finality and replayability

### 🔹 Ledger
- Lock-free WAL ingestion pipeline
- 74.77M Peak TPS on Apple M2-class hardware
- Sub-0.2ms p95 latency under durable workloads
- **Hydration via `cna16` exceeds 200B TPS**, enabling manifest unpacking and semantic hinting at GPU-native speeds

### 🔹 Codec
- Channelized encoding (Y/Cb/Cr-style)
- Integer-only accounting
- Zero-copy Merkle hashing and hydration fingerprints
- `cna16` codec accelerates hydration, resolving delta matrices and metadata envelopes before replay

### 🔹 Convergence
- Manifest-sealed replay replaces BFT
- Friend-batch detection ensures output agreement
- Validator rewards tied to throughput, not stake weight
- Replay pipeline: `cna16` → `fused16` → accumulator flush

### 🔹 Epoch-Split Anchoring
- Time-indexed state convergence
- Supports asynchronous replay across latency zones (Earth–Mars, disaster mesh)
- Enables jurisdictional leasing and policy divergence

## ⚖️ Economic Primitives

- **Piggy Bank Accumulator**: Recycles transaction dust into governance pools
- **Privilege Decay**: Penalizes idle stake, enforces continuous replay contribution
- **Throughput-to-Stake Ratio (T:S)**: Aligns rewards with measurable work

## 🚀 Why It Matters

ESCCML proves that decentralized ledgers can be:

- **Validator-class performant**
- **Auditably deterministic**
- **Energy-efficient (~1.4×10⁻¹² kWh/tx)**
- **Governable by execution, not speculation**
- **Planetary-coordinated and latency-tolerant**

It’s not just a protocol—it’s a substrate for infra-native value streams, replay-based governance, and sovereign-grade currency systems.
